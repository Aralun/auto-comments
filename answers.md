###[A] Question as answer
If you have a new question please [ask](http://$SITEURL$/questions/ask) so, but make sure you know what is [on-topic](http://$SITEURL$/help/on-topic) and you know [how to ask](http://$SITEURL$/help/how-to-ask). Don't post a question as an answer.

###[A] Me too!
Don't post *"me too"* as an answer, you can [up-vote](http://$SITEURL$/privileges/vote-up) the question if you have sufficient reputation. 

###[A] Link Only same site
Please don't post link only answers to other $SITENAME$ questions. Instead, vote/flag to close as duplicate, or, if the question is not a duplicate, *tailor the answer to this specific question.*

###[A] Please don't post answers
Please don't post answers on obviously off topic / bad questions! [See: **Should one advise on off topic questions?**](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/276572/1768232)

###[A] Identical answers
Please don't post identical answers to multiple questions. Post one good answer, then vote/flag to close the other questions as duplicates. If the question is not a duplicate, *tailor your answers to the question.*

###[A] Not enough rep to comment
Don't post answers to clarify another's answer. Since you don't have enough rep yet to comment, post your **own, complete answer** that can stand on its own if the other answer were to be deleted. Eventually you will have enough rep to comment on another's answer. Please [edit] this answer with additional details.

###[A] Self Promotion
Just linking to your own library or tutorial is not a good answer. Linking to it, explaining why it solves the problem, providing code on how to do so and disclaiming that you wrote it makes for a better answer. See: [**What signifies “Good” self promotion?**](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/182212/200235)

###[A] Question as an answer
Please make sure that your answer is phrased *as an answer*, not as a question.

###[A] Link Only Other Stack Exchange
Please don't post link only answers to other Stack Exchange questions. Instead, include the essential portions of the answer here, and *tailor the answer to this specific question.*

###[A] Language, please
I know you're excited, but please try to keep your language under control. Think of $SITENAME$ as more like Wikipedia than like Reddit.

###[A] Many formatting issues
Take a moment to read through the [editing help](http://$SITEURL$/editing-help) in the help center. Formatting on $SITENAME$ is different than other sites.

###[A] Code only answer
While this code snippet may solve the question, [including an explanation](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/114762/explaining-entirely-code-based-answers) really helps to improve the quality of your post. Remember that you are answering the question for readers in the future, and those people might not know the reasons for your code suggestion. Please also try not to crowd your code with explanatory comments, this reduces the readability of both the code and the explanations!

###[A] Borderline Link-Only answer
This is a borderline [link-only answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8231/213671). You should expand your answer to include as much information here, and use the link only for reference.

###[A] Borderline-spam link answer
Please be careful with linking to your own content on different sites, you don't want to be a [spammer](http://$SITEURL$/help/promotion). You should be including the majority of the content here, and use the link only as a reference.

###[A] Thanks answer
Please don't add "thanks" as answers. Invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient [privileges](//$SITEURL$/privileges) to upvote answers you like, which is the $SITENAME$ way of saying thank you.

###[A] OP using an answer for further information
Please use the *Post answer* button only for actual answers. You should [edit] your original question to add additional information.

###[A] OP adding a new question as an answer
If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button.
