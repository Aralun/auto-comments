###[Q] Burnination request
Thanks for posting this request and allowing the community to weigh in! Please note that burninating a tag is the process of carefully moderating a specific piece of Stack Overflow (please think twice before doing tag-only mass edits, as they can be counter-productive); once the community reaches a consensus, burnination can proceed. For more info, see [Shog9's answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/239191/306392) on MSE or the [unofficial SOCVR process](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/323121/4174897) on MSO.
